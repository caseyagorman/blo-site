        The Brass Liberation Orchestra makes loud on the streets to inspire, instigate, agitate, mourn, celebrate, and communicate. 
        We stand in solidarity with groups and movements who are working for a more just and equitable world.
 We work to build a multigender/multiracial/multigenerational group that enhances and strengthens the culture of the Left.</div>
